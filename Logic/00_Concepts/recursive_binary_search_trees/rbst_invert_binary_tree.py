    #   | - Private method to invert a binary tree.         |
    #   | - It swaps every left child with its right child  |
    #   |   recursively.                                    |
    #   |                                                   |
    #   | Parameters:                                       |
    #   | - node: The current node being visited.           |
    #   |                                                   |
    #   | Return:                                           |
    #   | - The node after its subtree has been inverted.   |

    #   | Tips:                                             |
    #   | - The function works recursively, swapping left   |
    #   |   and right children of all nodes in the tree.    |
    #   | - A temporary variable is used to facilitate the  |
    #   |   swap of the children.                           |

        # Before swapping, save the original left child of the node in a temporary
        # variable. This is crucial because we're about to overwrite node.left with
        # the inverted right subtree, and we need to preserve the original left subtree
        # for inverting it next.
        temp = node.left
    
        # Recursively invert the right subtree of the current node and assign it
        # to the left child of the current node. This begins the process of swapping
        # the left and right children of the node.
        node.left = self.__invert_tree(node.right)
    
        # Now, invert the original left subtree (which we've saved in temp) and assign
        # it to the right child of the current node. This completes the swapping process.
        # Note that we use the preserved original left subtree for this, ensuring that
        # each child is correctly inverted and placed.
        node.right = self.__invert_tree(temp)
        
        # Return the current node. Now that its children have been swapped (inverted),
        # it's part of the newly inverted tree structure. This return statement allows
        # the recursion to work its way up, inverting each node's children from the bottom
        # of the tree to the top.

## BASE CASE:
- What makes the function stop running

## RECURSION CASE:
- What makes the function keep calling itself

## FACTORIAL
- 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 4!
- 4 * 3!
- 4 * 3 * 2!
- 4 * 3 * 2 * 1!


## RECURSIVE PROBLEM SOLVING
- f(n)
1. Show f(1) works (base case)
2. Assume f(n - 1) works
3. Show f(n) works using f(n - 1) --> Define the relationship between f(n) and f(n-1)

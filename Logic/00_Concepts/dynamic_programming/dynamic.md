## Overlapping/Repeating Subproblems
- If a repeating subproblem has a known solution/value, we can store it in a list, and when we face the subproblem again, we can just go to that place in the list and grab the solution O(1)
- That is called Memoization lol

 ## Optimized Substructure
 - For example taking the lowest cost path for going from A to C in a graph
